        <h3>Description</h3>
        A plotter is a machine that produces vector graphics drawings. Plotters draw lines on paper using a pen, or in
        some applications, use a knife to cut a material like vinyl or leather. In the latter case, they are sometimes
        known as a cutting plotter.<br><br>
        In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided design, as they were able to produce line
        drawings much faster and of a higher quality than contemporary conventional printers. Smaller desktop plotters
        were often used for business graphics. Printers with graphics capabilities took away some of the market by the
        early 1980s, and the introduction of laser printers in the mid-1980s largely eliminated the use of plotters from
        most roles.<br><br>
        Plotters retained a niche for producing very large drawings for many years, but have now largely been replaced
        by wide-format conventional printers. Cutting plotters remain in use in a number of industries.
